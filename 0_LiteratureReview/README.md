  - **[https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10502664]()**
  - **Objective**: AI-powered dermatology in the realm of early skin cancer detection
  - **Methods**: Use Google Net Inception v3 CNN for malignant mole detection combined with other features
  - **Outcomes**: "dermatologist-level accuracy"
  - **Relation to the Project**: Also used a Pretrained model to classify cancer

- **Source 2**: Skin Cancer Classification using Transfer Learning

  - **Objective**: identify 7 distinct types of lesions
  - **Methods**: use ResNet50 model for malignant mole  
  - **Outcomes**: categorical accuracy, weighted average precision, and recall of 90 percent, 0.89, 0.90, respectively
  - **Relation to the Project**: Also used a Pretrained model to classify cancer
